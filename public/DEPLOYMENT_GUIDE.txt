DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
================

1. UPLOAD FILES:
   - Upload all contents of this 'public' folder to your InfinityFree htdocs directory
   - Ensure all files maintain their folder structure

2. CONFIGURE DATABASE:
   - Edit public/api/.env file with your InfinityFree MySQL credentials
   - Update the following values:
     * DB_HOST=your_database_host
     * DB_USERNAME=your_database_username  
     * DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
     * DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
     * JWT_SECRET=generate-a-random-32-character-string

3. IMPORT DATABASE:
   - Create a MySQL database in your InfinityFree control panel
   - Import the schema.sql file (from your original project) into the database
   - This creates all necessary tables and sample data

4. SET PERMISSIONS:
   - Ensure .htaccess files are readable (644)
   - Ensure PHP files are executable (644)
   - Ensure .env file is protected (600 if possible)

5. TEST YOUR DEPLOYMENT:
   - Visit your domain to see the React frontend
   - Login with: admin / admin (admin account)
   - Test API functionality through the interface

IMPORTANT NOTES:
===============
- The frontend is pre-configured to use /api for all backend requests
- All CORS headers are configured for InfinityFree compatibility
- The system supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
- JWT authentication is configured for secure access
- All routes are properly handled by .htaccess files

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- If you see 404 errors, check that .htaccess files are uploaded
- If database connection fails, verify your .env configuration
- If CORS errors occur, check your hosting panel's PHP settings
- For permission issues, contact InfinityFree support

SECURITY:
=========
- Change default admin password immediately after deployment
- Generate a secure JWT_SECRET key
- Keep your .env file secure and never share credentials
- Regularly backup your database

Your CBT Portal is now ready for production use on InfinityFree!
